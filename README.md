> I build software that works in the real world, not just in a README screenshot.  
> I write about practical AI, automation, and things that hold up after the first use.

### What I’m Doing

- Building practical AI systems and automation workflows that are reliable before they are flashy
- Writing about engineering tradeoffs, command-line productivity, and what’s useful in production
- Shipping prototypes quickly, validating quickly, and refining based on real feedback (often from mistakes)
